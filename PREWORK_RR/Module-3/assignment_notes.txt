Being in a fulltime job, I do understand it is not going to be easy attending classes and also allocating 20 hours a week towards self-learning. I have made some changes in my daily schedule and have been practicing it since the day I was accepted to the course. I get to office by 5:45AM each day and use all the time till 8:30AM towards learning. I strongly believe this will help me be successful in the course. 
I have a general tendency to lose interest in topic once I understand the topic or its working at a high level. I then move on to the next new thing. I do understand to be successful in coding, one needs to practice hard and go deep into the topic. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to take up this program. The scheduled classes and assignments will provide me with the necessary guardrails to ensure I learn the coding topics in depth rather than focusing on the breadth.
