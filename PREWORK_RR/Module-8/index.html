        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. The founding members were Glenn Frey (lead guitar, lead vocals), Don Henley (drums, lead vocals), Bernie Leadon (guitars, vocals) and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals). With five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and six number-one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975) and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p>

        <div class="lyricColumn">
            <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
                <br> Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
                <br> Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
                <br> My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
                <br> I had to stop for the night.</p>
            <p>There she stood in the doorway;
                <br> I heard the mission bell
                <br> And I was thinking to myself
                <br> 'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
                <br> Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
                <br> There were voices down the corridor,
                <br> I thought I heard them say</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
                <br> Such a lovely face.
                <br> Plenty of room at the Hotel California
                <br> Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here</p>
            <p>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
                <br> She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
                <br> How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
                <br> Some dance to remember, some dance to forget</p>
            <p>So I called up the Captain,
                <br> 'Please bring me my wine'
                <br> He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
                <br> And still those voices are calling from far away,
                <br> Wake you up in the middle of the night
                <br> Just to hear them say"</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Hotel California
                <br> Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
                <br> Such a lovely face.
                <br> They livin' it up at the Hotel California
                <br> What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis</p>
            <p>Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device' And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast</p>
            <p>Last thing I remember, I was
                <br> Running for the door
                <br> I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
                <br> 'Relax' said the night man,
                <br> 'We are programmed to receive.
                <br> You can check out any time you like,
                <br> But you can never leave!'</p>
